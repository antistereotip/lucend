Li-Fi (commonly referred to as LiFi) is a wireless communication technology which utilizes light to transmit data and position 
between devices. The term was first introduced by Harald Haas during a 2011 TEDGlobal talk in Edinburgh.
Li-Fi is a light communication system that is capable of transmitting data at high speeds over the visible light, 
ultraviolet, and infrared spectrums.
In terms of its end user, the technology is similar to Wi-Fi â€“ the key technical difference being that Wi-Fi uses radio 
frequency to induce an electric tension in an antenna to transmit data, whereas Li-Fi uses the modulation of light intensity 
to transmit data. Li-Fi is able to function in areas otherwise susceptible to electromagnetic interference 
(e.g. aircraft cabins, hospitals, or military applications).
